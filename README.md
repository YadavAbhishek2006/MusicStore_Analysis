# Business Insights from Music Store Data Using MySQL
## Overview
This project involves analyzing a music store’s relational database to extract valuable business insights and recommendations. MySQL is used to query the dataset and Excel is used to summarize results with tables and charts. The goal is to uncover trends in sales, customer behavior, and product performance to help inform marketing, inventory, and sales strategies. For example, queries on sales data and customer preferences can answer key business questions about revenue and product trends.

## Objectives
#### •	Customer Analysis:
      •	Identify the top customers by total spending.
   
      •	Analyze customer purchase behavior and preferences (e.g., favorite genres or artists).

#### •	Sales and Revenue:
      •	Calculate total sales and average invoice values by city, country, or region.
   
      •	Determine peak sales periods (monthly/seasonal trends) and highest-grossing markets.
   
#### •	Product and Genre Insights:
      •	Find the best-selling tracks, albums, and artists by units sold and revenue.
   
      •	Analyze popular music genres by region or customer segment to guide inventory stocking.
#### •	Marketing and Distribution:
      •	Identify key cities or countries to target for promotions (e.g., city with highest revenue).
   
      •	Evaluate sales distribution across regions to optimize marketing and distribution efforts.
## •	Operations:
      •	Determine the senior-most employee (highest job level) to understand store leadership hierarchy.
   
## Tools Used
   •	**MySQL**: An open-source relational database (RDBMS) for storing and querying the music store data.
   
   •	**Excel**: Used for reporting and basic data visualization.
## Dataset Source
A sample music store database is used as the data source, inspired by open retail music datasets like the Chinook sample database. The Chinook database is a well-known test dataset for a digital media store, including tables for customers, invoices, tracks, albums, and artists
## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates how SQL and Excel together can turn raw sales data into actionable insights. The queries identify the top-spending customers, most profitable cities, and best-selling music products. These insights can inform marketing strategies (such as targeting high-revenue cities for promotions) and inventory decisions (like stocking more of the most popular genres). In summary, this project illustrates how structured querying and reporting can support data-driven decision-making in a retail context.
